        Particularly when working with pages, it may be desirable to remove all
        of the existing page's contents and emplace (insert) a new page on top
        of it, in a way that preserves all links and references to the original
        page. (Or similarly, for other Dictionary objects in a PDF.)

        Any Dictionary keys in the iterable *retain* are preserved. By default,
        /Parent is retained.

        When a page is assigned (``pdf.pages[0] = new_page``), only the
        application knows if references to the original the original page are
        still valid. For example, a PDF optimizer might restructure a page
        object into another visually similar one, and references would be valid;
        but for a program that reorganizes page contents such as a N-up
        compositor, references may not be valid anymore.

        This method takes precautions to ensure that child objects in common
        with ``self`` and ``other`` are not inadvertently deleted.

        Args:
            filename_or_stream: Where to write the output. If a file
                exists in this location it will be overwritten.
                If the file was opened with ``allow_overwriting_input=True``,
                then it is permitted to overwrite the original file, and
                this parameter may be omitted to implicitly use the original
                filename. Otherwise, the filename may not be the same as the
                input file, as overwriting the input file would corrupt data
                since pikepdf using lazy loading.

            static_id: Indicates that the ``/ID`` metadata, normally
                calculated as a hash of certain PDF contents and metadata
                including the current time, should instead be set to a static
                value. Only use this for debugging and testing. Use
                ``deterministic_id`` if you want to get the same ``/ID`` for
                the same document contents.
            preserve_pdfa: Ensures that the file is generated in a
                manner compliant with PDF/A and other stricter variants.
                This should be True, the default, in most cases.

            min_version: Sets the minimum version of PDF
                specification that should be required. If left alone QPDF
                will decide. If a tuple, the second element is an integer, the
                extension level. If the version number is not a valid format,
                QPDF will decide what to do.
            force_version: Override the version recommend by QPDF,
                potentially creating an invalid file that does not display
                in old versions. See QPDF manual for details. If a tuple, the
                second element is an integer, the extension level.
            fix_metadata_version: If ``True`` (default) and the XMP metadata
                contains the optional PDF version field, ensure the version in
                metadata is correct. If the XMP metadata does not contain a PDF
                version field, none will be added. To ensure that the field is
                added, edit the metadata and insert a placeholder value in
                ``pdf:PDFVersion``. If XMP metadata does not exist, it will
                not be created regardless of the value of this argument.

            object_stream_mode:
                ``disable`` prevents the use of object streams.
                ``preserve`` keeps object streams from the input file.
                ``generate`` uses object streams wherever possible,
                creating the smallest files but requiring PDF 1.5+.

            compress_streams: Enables or disables the compression of
                uncompressed stream objects. By default this is set to
                ``True``, and the only reason to set it to ``False`` is for
                debugging or inspecting PDF contents.

                When enabled, uncompressed stream objects will be compressed
                whether they were uncompressed in the PDF when it was opened,
                or when the user creates new :class:`pikepdf.Stream` objects
                attached to the PDF. Stream objects can also be created
                indirectly, such as when content from another PDF is merged
                into the one being saved.

                Only stream objects that have no compression will be
                compressed when this object is set. If the object is
                compressed, compression will be preserved.

                Setting compress_streams=False does not trigger decompression
                unless decompression is specifically requested by setting
                both ``compress_streams=False`` and ``stream_decode_level``
                to the desired decode level (e.g. ``.generalized`` will
                decompress most non-image content).

                This option does not trigger recompression of existing
                compressed streams. For that, use ``recompress_flate``.

                The XMP metadata stream object, if present, is never
                compressed, to facilitate metadata reading by parsers that
                don't understand the full structure of PDF.

            stream_decode_level: Specifies how
                to encode stream objects. See documentation for
                :class:`pikepdf.StreamDecodeLevel`.

            recompress_flate: When disabled (the default), qpdf does not
                uncompress and recompress streams compressed with the Flate
                compression algorithm. If True, pikepdf will instruct qpdf to
                do this, which may be useful if recompressing streams to a
                higher compression level.

            normalize_content: Enables parsing and reformatting the
                content stream within PDFs. This may debugging PDFs easier.

            linearize: Enables creating linear or "fast web view",
                where the file's contents are organized sequentially so that
                a viewer can begin rendering before it has the whole file.
                As a drawback, it tends to make files larger.

            qdf: Save output QDF mode.  QDF mode is a special output
                mode in QPDF to allow editing of PDFs in a text editor. Use
                the program ``fix-qdf`` to fix convert back to a standard
                PDF.

            progress: Specify a callback function that is called
                as the PDF is written. The function will be called with an
                integer between 0-100 as the sole parameter, the progress
                percentage. This function may not access or modify the PDF
                while it is being written, or data corruption will almost
                certainly occur.

            encryption: If ``False``
                or omitted, existing encryption will be removed. If ``True``
                encryption settings are copied from the originating PDF.
                Alternately, an ``Encryption`` object may be provided that
                sets the parameters for new encryption.

            deterministic_id: Indicates that the ``/ID`` metadata, normally
                calculated as a hash of certain PDF contents and metadata
                including the current time, should instead be computed using
                only deterministic data like the file contents. At a small
                runtime cost, this enables generation of the same ``/ID`` if
                the same inputs are converted in the same way multiple times.
                Does not work for encrypted files.

        Raises:
            PdfError
            ForeignObjectError
            ValueError

        You may call ``.save()`` multiple times with different parameters
        to generate different versions of a file, and you *may* continue
        to modify the file after saving it. ``.save()`` does not modify
        the ``Pdf`` object in memory, except possibly by updating the XMP
        metadata version with ``fix_metadata_version``.

        .. note::

            :meth:`pikepdf.Pdf.remove_unreferenced_resources` before saving
            may eliminate unnecessary resources from the output file if there
            are any objects (such as images) that are referenced in a page's
            Resources dictionary but never called in the page's content stream.

        .. note::

            pikepdf can read PDFs with incremental updates, but always
            coalesces any incremental updates into a single non-incremental
            PDF file when saving.

        .. note::
            If filename_or_stream is a stream and the process is interrupted during
            writing, the stream may be left in a corrupt state. It is the
            responsibility of the caller to manage the stream in this case.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.7
            Added *recompress_flate*.

            Keyword arguments now mandatory for everything except the first
            argument.

        .. versionchanged:: 8.1
            If filename_or_stream is a filename and that file exists, the new file
            is written to a temporary file in the same directory and then moved into
            place. This prevents the existing destination file from being corrupted
            if the process is interrupted during writing; previously, corrupting the
            destination file was possible. If no file exists at the destination, output
            is written directly to the destination, but the destination will be deleted
            if errors occur during writing. Prior to 8.1, the file was always written
            directly to the destination, which could result in a corrupt destination
            file if the process was interrupted during writing.

        If *filename_or_stream* is path-like, the file will be opened for reading.
        The file should not be modified by another process while it is open in
        pikepdf, or undefined behavior may occur. This is because the file may be
        lazily loaded. Despite this restriction, pikepdf does not try to use any OS
        services to obtain an exclusive lock on the file. Some applications may
        want to attempt this or copy the file to a temporary location before
        editing. This behaviour changes if *allow_overwriting_input* is set: the whole
        file is then read and copied to memory, so that pikepdf can overwrite it
        when calling ``.save()``.

        When this function is called with a stream-like object, you must ensure
        that the data it returns cannot be modified, or undefined behavior will
        occur.

        Any changes to the file must be persisted by using ``.save()``.

        If *filename_or_stream* has ``.read()`` and ``.seek()`` methods, the file
        will be accessed as a readable binary stream. pikepdf will read the
        entire stream into a private buffer.

        ``.open()`` may be used in a ``with``-block; ``.close()`` will be called when
        the block exits, if applicable.

        Whenever pikepdf opens a file, it will close it. If you open the file
        for pikepdf or give it a stream-like object to read from, you must
        release that object when appropriate.

        Examples:
            >>> with Pdf.open("test.pdf") as pdf:
                    ...

            >>> pdf = Pdf.open("test.pdf", password="rosebud")

        Args:
            filename_or_stream: Filename or Python readable and seekable file
                stream of PDF to open.
            password: User or owner password to open an
                encrypted PDF. If the type of this parameter is ``str``
                it will be encoded as UTF-8. If the type is ``bytes`` it will
                be saved verbatim. Passwords are always padded or
                truncated to 32 bytes internally. Use ASCII passwords for
                maximum compatibility.
            hex_password: If True, interpret the password as a
                hex-encoded version of the exact encryption key to use, without
                performing the normal key computation. Useful in forensics.
            ignore_xref_streams: If True, ignore cross-reference
                streams. See qpdf documentation.
            suppress_warnings: If True (default), warnings are not
                printed to stderr. Use :meth:`pikepdf.Pdf.get_warnings()` to
                retrieve warnings.
            attempt_recovery: If True (default), attempt to recover
                from PDF parsing errors.
            inherit_page_attributes: If True (default), push attributes
                set on a group of pages to individual pages
            access_mode: If ``.default``, pikepdf will
                decide how to access the file. Currently, it will always
                selected stream access. To attempt memory mapping and fallback
                to stream if memory mapping failed, use ``.mmap``.  Use
                ``.mmap_only`` to require memory mapping or fail
                (this is expected to only be useful for testing). Applications
                should be prepared to handle the SIGBUS signal on POSIX in
                the event that the file is successfully mapped but later goes
                away.
            allow_overwriting_input: If True, allows calling ``.save()``
                to overwrite the input file. This is performed by loading the
                entire input file into memory at open time; this will use more
                memory and may recent performance especially when the opened
                file will not be modified.

        Raises:
            pikepdf.PasswordError: If the password failed to open the
                file.
            pikepdf.PdfError: If for other reasons we could not open
                the file.

                usable.
            FileNotFoundError: If the file was not found.

        Note:
            When *filename_or_stream* is a stream and the stream is located on a
            network, pikepdf assumes that the stream using buffering and read caches
            to achieve reasonable performance. Streams that fetch data over a network
            in response to every read or seek request, no matter how small, will
            perform poorly. It may be easier to download a PDF from network to
            temporary local storage (such as ``io.BytesIO``), manipulate it, and
            then re-upload it.
